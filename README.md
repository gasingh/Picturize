# Picturize

_This is a drone mapping tool to help landscape & urban designers to make visual memories from aerial surveys.
The tool can read photo dumps from drones and from mobile phone cameras and visualize the images onto a Digital Terrain Model in 3D space.
It utilizes the opensource [exif tool](https://exiftool.org/) library at the backend to make this possible. The front end is a toolbar in Rhino 3D which facilitates user interaction._

**Abstract**  

  As a part of my final master thesis project at ETH Zurich, i worked on a plugin in Rhino 3D to visualize imagery acquired by devices with geo-location capacities. It's called PICTURIZE. The tool can READ raw files: camlogs and img-sets from drones, and images from digital cameras & mobile phones to place them in a digital terrain model.

**Image Acquisition** 

  The study uses photographic data from two devices:
  
  - Nexus 5 mobile phone (Google) | Terrestrial Imagery
    - <img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398561/211146385-e52d006b-9267-465c-a502-a924ddbbcfa3.jpg" height = 200>
  - AscTec Falcon 8 Octocopter Drone (Ascending Technologies)  | Aerial Imagery
    - <img src= "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6398561/211146373-d98a8933-ae3f-462d-b323-5349f233fe75.jpg" width = 500> <br> 
  
**Digital Terrain Meshes** 
  
  The digital terrain meshes are acquired from here:
  
  - [Federal Office of Topography - swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/)
